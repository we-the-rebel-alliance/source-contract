/**
 * The conformance kit: one report per source, from a declaration and the plugin's own answers.
 *
 * The kit runs the plugin's reads itself, through a recording permission whose rules are the grants the declaration
 * derives. So a read that asserts more than the declaration holds is refused where the host would refuse it, and a
 * grant no read asserts is reported at the end: declared equals asserted. There are two such sessions, and they never
 * mix: the **running** session holds the source's own action and `permission.operations`, and the **bind** session holds
 * only `scope.suggest`'s tool and operations, because a bind-time read never enters a running grant.
 *
 * The kit takes page results, cursors and permission contexts as inputs. It defines no page, cursor or permission of its
 * own: those are the `events`, `cursor` and `permission` modules' work.
 *
 * The calls it makes, which a plugin's test adapts to its own tools:
 *
 *   list({ ...input }, context)                 → the page result of events_list
 *   probe({ source, account? }, context)        → { account, owner, scopes? }
 *   details[id]({ account, scope, fields })     → the page result of one detail read
 *   suggest({ source, account }, context)       → { options: [{ id, label? }] }, in the bind session
 *   snapshot({ params? }, context)              → the snapshot result, recorded for its grants only
 *
 * `context.permission.assert` is that session's permission: a read asserts the actions and operations it uses.
