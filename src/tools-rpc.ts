/**
 * The tools RPC, version 2.3: every known tool a plugin owns or exposes, as an RPC method, so a script can call it
 * with no model. The family's shared `src/host/tools-rpc.ts` v2 (the part outside the PLUGIN-SPECIFIC block, identical
 * in all 24 plugins; SHA-256 of that part 15d82caa…2a6d), with Memory's v2.3 per-method resource resolver merged in.
 * `docs/tools-rpc.md` explains every change from v2 and from Memory's version.
 *
 *   POST /api/rpc/<plugin id>.tools/<method>
 *   { "input": { "sessionID": "<session>", "input": <the tool's input> } }
 *
 * A script runs as a session and the agent it names. The rules that decide are the agent's, then the session's, with
 * the host's own order (the last matching rule wins), which is also the order the model path uses:
 * - the rule for the method's permission action is resolved BEFORE dispatch; only `allow` runs, so an `ask` is refused
 *   with no prompt and no tool call, and a `deny` is refused with no tool call;
 * - (v2.3) a plugin method with a `resource(input)` resolver is resolved on that resource, `<account>:<operation>`,
 *   instead of `*`: a rule on `gws.read` for `work:gmail.users.messages.get` grants exactly that read. A resolver that
 *   names no resource (`null`) is refused, naming the input. A read method's operation must be a read (its last dotted
 *   segment starts with a read verb). A method with no resolver resolves on `*`, exactly as v2 does;
 * - an MCP method then runs through OpenCode's own executor from `ctx.tool.list()`, which checks `<server>_<tool>`
 *   against the agent's rules, the session's rules and saved approvals, and sends OpenCode's own credential;
 * - a plugin-owned method runs its own spec, with its own `ctx.permission.assert` calls;
 * - the `evaluate` hook still refuses any inner `ask` of this RPC's own calls in flight (their source ids), so an
 *   inner action the method needs is named in the error, not left waiting;
 * - a saved approval from an earlier "Always allow" is NOT part of `agent ++ session` rules, so it does not authorize
 *   an ad-hoc script. That is deliberate (v2, D-F): a script's grant is a rule in config, or a Jobs run session.
 *
 * Every known tool is a method, by exact name, with a class. A tool the server adds later is not a method until it is
 * classified in the plugin's table; `describe` lists it as `unclassified`.
 *
 * The executor bypasses `execute.before` and `execute.after` hooks, so `shapeInput` runs before dispatch and
 * `shapeResult` after it, whatever those hooks do on the model path.
 *
 * In the package, what v2 kept in the PLUGIN-SPECIFIC block (the plugin's id, its next steps, its shapers and its error
 * mapping) is the `plugin` option, and the method table stays the `methods` option. Dependency-free: `node:crypto`
 * only; the host's types are structural, and `Rpc.define` (an identity with one check) is `defineRpc` here.
