/**
 * Permission: the exact OpenCode session rules a grant allows (design §3, "the trust rule").
 *
 * Every read runs in a session limited to these rules. OpenCode checks each inner tool call a plugin makes against the
 * calling session's rules, and the last matching rule wins, so the rules are a deny of everything, then one allow per
 * action and resource the source declares:
 *
 *   [{ action: "*", resource: "*", effect: "deny" },
 *    { action: "gws.events_list", resource: "*", effect: "allow" },
 *    { action: "gws.read", resource: "ana@example.com:gmail.users.messages.list", effect: "allow" }, …]
 *
 * The method's action is allowed on `*`, because the tools RPC resolves a method before dispatch on `*` (version 2; a
 * method with a version 2.3 resource resolver is resolved on its resource, which the operation rules cover). Each
 * operation is allowed as Memory's schema and conformance kit read it (`operationRule`): a dotted operation as
 * `<namespace>.read` on `<account>:<operation>` (gws: `gws.read` on `ana@example.com:gmail.users.messages.get`), and a
 * bare one, an MCP tool, as `<namespace>_<operation>` on `*` (Slack: `slack_slack_read_channel`). The namespace is the
 * source id's first segment.
 *
 * The broker and a project may only narrow these rules, and the plugin's own `access` setting stays final.
